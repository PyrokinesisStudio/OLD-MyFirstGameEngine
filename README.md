## Warning: This was one of my first attempts to create a game engine
###### So just clone it if you really want to see something "weird" about my game dev/programming evolution.
I was going to delete this repository. But I thinked a lot and decided to keep them as a memory of my evolution.
I made this code when I was a kid. I had no idea what I was doing. No knowledge about advanced coding (even classes, I had no idea), different files, organization. Don't criticize this work. I only uploaded to github because my friend asked me a lot. 

So, thanks :D
